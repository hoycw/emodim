%% Find trials that overlap with epochs by comparing sample indices
%   Mainly used to find trials that overlap with visually identified artifacts
% INPUTS:
%   epochs [Nx2 int array] - array of [start,stop] pairs of sample indicies marking the epochs
%   sample_idx [Nx1 int array] - array of sample indicies for the
%       continuous data, to be cut into trials based on events+trial_lim
%       e.g., 1:size(data.trial{1},2)
%   events [int array] - sample indices indicating the segmentation point for trials
%   trial_lim [1x2 int array] - # data points to include [before, after] the event
% OUTPUTS:
%   overlap_trials [Nx1 int array] - column vector of trial indices that overlap with any epochs
